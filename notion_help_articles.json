Things you can do to speed up your database setup\n\nIf you have a large workspace, avoid having lots of inline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup. Try housing each database in its own page first. Once you‚Äôve done that, if you‚Äôd like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can: ‚Ä¢ Type /linked in that page and select Linked view of a database to create a linked database.\n‚Ä¢ Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases.

Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases! When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup. Formulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate. Databases that are filtered and sorted on formula and rollup properties may take a bit longer to load.",

  "content": "Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed. If some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity. We suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If that‚Äôs not an option for you, adding a filter on the Created time property to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.

Configuring Notion for HIPAA\n\nHIPAA Technical Safeguard Requirements | Notion's Supporting Configurations\nAccess ControlImplement technical policies and procedures for electronic information systems that maintain electronic protected health information to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights. | Notion‚Äôs SAML SSO is built upon the SAML 2.0 standard, connecting your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience. Notion supports official configurations for SAML SSO with: Azure, Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.To get started using SAML SSO with Notion, you'll need to complete the following steps:Verify domain(s):To use advanced security features, you must verify ownership of your email domain. This is an automated process that involves adding a TXT record onto your domain‚Äôs DNS to verify your ownership of it.Enable SAML SSO:This will toggle the feature on and complete the configuration. For more information on completing the SAML SSO configuration, please refer tothis article.Change default login method:Once SAML SSO is enabled for the first time, the default login method will be set toAny method, meaning that users have the option of logging in via SAML or their normal login method. By setting this toOnly SAML SSO, this enforces SAML as the login method for your workspace for managed users with verified company emails.Link additional workspaces:If you have more than one workspace you‚Äôd like to configure with SSO, you can do so by reaching out toteam@makenotion.com.Once properly configured, any members signing into your workspace(s) will need to use the verified domain and will need to be authenticated through your identity provider. Enterprise workspace owners are able to bypass by using an alternative login method in case there‚Äôs an IdP/SAML SSO failure.\nUnique User IdentificationAssign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity. | Notion has a SCIM API which can be used to provision, manage, and de-provision members and groups.

Notion supports official SCIM applications with Google, Gusto, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling.\nEmergency Access ProcedureEstablish (and implement as needed) procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information during an emergency. | Content search provides Enterprise workspace owners with visibility into workspace content to improve governance of the workspace and resolve page access issues. Content search allows you to:‚Ä¢ View who has access to a page‚Ä¢ Modify the permissions of a page‚Ä¢ Discover and re-assign abandoned pages from former employeesYou can export a Notion page, database, or entire workspace at any time.\nAutomatic LogoffImplement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity. | Set custom session duration:For managed users on the Enterprise Plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days. However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.Force logout managed users:Force logout for individual users or for all workspace users at once.Force password reset:Force password reset for individual users or for all workspace users at once.If you de-provision a user via SCIM, they will be removed from the workspace and their session will be terminated.\nAudit ControlsImplement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information. | Enterprise workspace owners have access to an Audit Log viaSettings. This gives an overview of a large range of events that have occurred in the workspace.This can be especially helpful for identifying potential security issues, investigating suspicious behavior, and troubleshooting access.

You don‚Äôt need to use this control if you‚Äôd like to invite guests as needed, but note that Notion may not be used to communicate with patients, plan members, or their families and employers.
